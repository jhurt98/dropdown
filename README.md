To test: 
1. Clone this repo
2. cd into the directory
3. run npm install
4. run npm start

- make sure port 3000 is not busy
- tested with node version 20.11.1 and npm 10.2.4
- if you run into compilation errors regarding module imports or eslint, please make sure your versions of node and npm are up to date. If not please update with nvm, remove node_modules and rerun steps 3,4.
- if that still doesn't work please reference the demo video :) 

Implementation details
- the main file to look at is ./src/Dropdown.js
